版本 v1.5
几年前写的，后面一直放着没管了，现在有空做了一点小的更新。
考虑到有些公司SAP服务器不能访问外网，发请求做的是走自己电脑的，只要自己电脑能连外网，就可以访问云端代码。
有兴趣和精力一起完善代码的朋友联系15104912340@qq.com
 
用途
输入程序名，根据程序名检索程序所有依赖，包含INCLUDE，函数，CLASS，表、数据元素、域、锁、TCODE等等，导出到本地文件或者云端，可再导入生成所有对象并包入传输请求，也可以不导入在线直接查看代码。可用于：
备份程序
迁移程序
分享程序
查找程序

Version v1.5
I wrote it a few years ago, but I don't care about it all the time. Now I have time to do a little update.
Considering that SAP servers of some companies can't access the Internet, they send requests to their own computers. As long as their own computers can connect to the Internet, they can access the cloud code.
